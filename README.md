# Journal
This is my first simple app that made to help me learn Android Development using Java. Its a simple Journal app that uses Firebase Database and Firebase Google Authentication systems.
# Things that i learnt:
  1) RecyclerView,
  2) Firebase Database
  3) Firebase Auth.
  # updates:
  The app is not well structured,  and i will endevour to keep on improving the code quality and design until it meets and surpasses the development standards
